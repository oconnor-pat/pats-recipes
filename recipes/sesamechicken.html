<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
  Sesame chicken is a popular Chinese-American dish known for its delectable
  flavors and satisfying textures. This savory dish typically features tender
  chunks of boneless chicken, which are coated in a light batter and then
  deep-fried to achieve a crispy exterior. The chicken is then tossed in a
  glossy, sweet and tangy sauce that is infused with sesame oil and sprinkled
  with toasted sesame seeds. The result is a delightful combination of succulent
  chicken, crispy coating, and nutty undertones from the sesame seeds. Sesame
  chicken is often served with steamed rice or alongside a medley of stir-fried
  vegetables, making it a delicious and comforting choice for Asian cuisine
  enthusiasts.
