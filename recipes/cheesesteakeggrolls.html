<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
  Cheesesteak egg rolls are a delicious fusion of two beloved dishes, combining
  the flavors of classic cheesesteak sandwiches with the crispy texture of egg
  rolls. This mouthwatering appetizer typically features thinly sliced steak,
  saut√©ed onions, and melted cheese, all rolled up in a delicate egg roll
  wrapper and deep-fried to golden perfection. The tender beef, caramelized
  onions, and gooey cheese create a delectable filling that is perfectly
  complemented by the crispy exterior of the egg roll. Cheesesteak egg rolls are
  often served with dipping sauces such as spicy ketchup or sriracha mayo,
  adding an extra layer of flavor to this delightful snack or appetizer option.
